Here's where we'll put our "final" analysis scripts.

Basically, once we've done something in our exploratory
folders that we're happy with, we'll need to port them
over to a clean command-line-callable script in this folder.
These scripts should each only do one thing (e.g. `alpha_diversity.py`
or `qvalues.py`) and output files with results in `../../data/analysis`.
